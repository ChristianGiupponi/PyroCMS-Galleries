### How it works
This module is well integrated with Files module and built on Streams API so you can easly add all the fields you need.  
Basically this module create for you a Main folder in the Files module in which place all your galleries, just remember that **1 folder is 1 gallery**.  
The module provide you the possibility to add category to the gallery and give you a built in interface to manage the SEO for each gallery so you can have all the control you need over the SEO functionality.


### How to install
Just Download and unzip the archive.  
Place the downloaded folder in the **addons/shared_addons/modules** fodler and make sure it is named as **galleries**.  
Open the folder and find the **folder_list** folder and copy it in **addons/shared_addons/field_types/** and then remove it from the previous place.

Log in to the admin area of PyroCMS and install the module as usual.

NB:  
This module works only in the shared_addons folder.

### Compatibility
This module has been tested on 2.2.x branch, is not compatibile with the 2.3 (I will update it as soon as I can) and I'm not sure that works in the old PyroCMS version
